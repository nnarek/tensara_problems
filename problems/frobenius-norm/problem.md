Implement Frobenius Normalization for a tensor of arbitrary shape.

The Frobenius Normalization of a tensor involves dividing each element by the Frobenius norm of the entire tensor.

$$
\text{y} = \frac{x}{\|x\|_F}
$$

where $\|x\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm, which is calculated as:

$$
\|x\|_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i} x_i^2}
$$

where $i$ iterates through all elements of the tensor.

## Input:
- Tensor $\text{X}$ of arbitrary shape (input data)
- Total number of elements in the tensor (size)

## Output:
- Tensor $\text{Y}$ with the same shape as input (normalized data)

## Notes:
- The Frobenius norm is equivalent to treating the tensor as a flattened vector and computing its L2 norm.
- Every element in the output tensor will have the same normalization factor applied.
- The implementation should be able to handle tensors of _any_ dimensionality.
